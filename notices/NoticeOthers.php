      <p class="card-text">On the 22nd of September 2017, SLGTI hosted its first blood donation and health awareness programme.
       The Event Committee organised this student activity and supported the blood donation event accordingly.Due to a shortage of blood at
        Hospitals in Jaffna and Kilinochchi, SLGTI management decided to support the hospitals and making aware of this issue. It’s never
         too late — or too early — to make blood donation a lifelong habit. High school and college students account for about 20 percent of 
         all blood donations. SLGTI students can begin donating at 18 years old, and continue to donate as long as they meet eligibility
          requirements.First of all, the students were weighted and their blood got tested. After a brief interview about their health situation,
           they were invited to donate their blood. Hospital staff from Kilinochchi brought their equipment to SLGTI, so that 48 students
            (as well as several SLGTI staff members) had the honor to donate their blood and help saving lives. Special thanks to the 
            Event Committee for supporting all brave donors for the benefit of the community.</p>

        SLGTI is such a Green College and is following the Green College approach as part of the CSR strategy. Currently, the SLGTI campus/compound is
